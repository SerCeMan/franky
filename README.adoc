Franky - a simple profiler that always speaks frankly

== Project Goals

Goal of this project is creating profiler which

 * Is truthful, because it is built on the top of private JVM API (AsyncGetCallTrace)
 * Can attach to any JVM on the fly
 * Have a rich integration with IDE with navigation and inspections showing you how to improve your code based on profiling results (actually, Franky is a plugin for IntelliJ IDEA)

== Rationale

== Get it

Franky can be installed as a plugin for IntelliJ IDEA. While Franky is still in alpha you can install it from my own plugin repository using https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2016.1/custom-plugin-repositories-dialog.html[Custom Plugin Repositories Dialog]

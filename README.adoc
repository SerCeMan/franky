Franky - a simple profiler that always speaks frankly

== Project Goals

Goal of this project is creating profiler which

 * Is truthful, because it is built on the top of private JVM API (AsyncGetCallTrace)
 * Can attach to any JVM on the fly
 * Easy to understand because UI is based on famous flame graphs
 * Have a rich integration with IDE with navigation and inspections showing you how to improve your code based on profiling results (actually, Franky is a plugin for IntelliJ IDEA)

== How to

 * View -> Tool Windows -> Franky Profiler
 * Choose JVM and press 'start profiling'
 * Enjoy the result!
